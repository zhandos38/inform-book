<p>In _____________encryption, there is only one key, and all communicating parties use the same key for encryption and decryption. In________________, or public key, encryption, there are two keys: one key is used for encryption, and a different key is used for____________. Either key can be used for either action, but data encrypted with the first key can only be decrypted with the second key, and vice versa. This type of security is a foundational technology for <strong>SSL</strong> (TLS)</p>
<p>__________________security is a security mechanism used to authenticate and provide access to a facility or system based on the automatic and instant verification of an individual's physical characteristics. Because biometric security evaluates an individual&rsquo;s bodily elements or biological data, it is the strongest and most fool proof physical security technique used for identity___________________. Biological data used include________________, eye texture, voice, hand patterns and facial recognition.</p>
<p>Another measure of security is via the use of firewall. It carefully analyze incoming traffic based on pre-established rules and filter traffic coming from unsecured or suspicious sources to prevent attacks.</p>
