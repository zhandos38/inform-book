<p><strong><em>Instructions:</em></strong></p>
<p>Choose a short passage or dialogue and make several copies. Put the copies up around the walls of the classroom (or even the school building).</p>
<p>Put the students in pairs or small groups. The aim is for one of the students in each pair to walk (or run!) to read the passage on the wall. They remember some of the passage and walk (or run!) back to their partner. They quietly dictate what they remembered to their partner, who writes it down. They then swap roles. Over several turns they will build the whole passage. This means they really do have to run back and forth because students will only remember three or four words at a time.</p>
<p>The winning pair is the team that finishes first&nbsp;&ndash; although you&nbsp;need to check for mistakes. If there are mistakes, they must keep walking to check!</p>

    <li>Programs&nbsp;usually use&nbsp;data&nbsp;in some shape or form. Data is often stored within a program using variables and constants.</li>
    <li>Variable&nbsp;is a named piece of&nbsp;memory&nbsp;that holds a value. The value held in a variable can - and usually does - change as the program is running.</li>
    <li>A variable's name is known as an&nbsp;identifier. The identifier given to a variable usually follows certain rules known as a naming convention.</li>
    <li>Each&nbsp;variable&nbsp;has a&nbsp;data type. The data type determines what type of value the variable will hold</li>
    <li>A&nbsp;constant&nbsp;is a named piece of memory where the value cannot be changed while a program runs.</li>
    <li>A global variable is one that can be accessed and changed throughout the whole program.</li>
    <li>Local variables only exist within a particular&nbsp;subroutine.</li>
