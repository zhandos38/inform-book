                    <p>Computers have different types of memory.</p>
                    <p>Read-only memory &ndash; or ROM &ndash; holds instructions for starting up the computer.</p>
                    <p>Random access memory &ndash; or RAM &ndash; is where information and data currently in use is stored, so that it can be accessed quickly. When RAM becomes full, data is moved to the computer&rsquo;s virtual memory, a temporary place on the hard drive.</p>
                    <p>But using virtual memory slows down the computer's performance. That&rsquo;s because data has to be transferred back and forth between RAM and virtual memory as needed.</p>
                    <p>RAM is volatile, which means the data is lost every time the computer is switched off &ndash; unlike ROM which is non-volatile.</p>
