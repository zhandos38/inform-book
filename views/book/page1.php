<h2><strong>Virtual Reality vs. Augmented Reality</strong></h2><br>
<p>One of the biggest confusions in the world of&nbsp;<a href="http://augment.com/">augmented reality</a>&nbsp;is the difference between augmented reality and virtual reality. &nbsp;Both are earning a lot of media attention and are promising tremendous growth. &nbsp;So, what is the difference between virtual&nbsp;reality vs. augmented&nbsp;reality?</p>
<p><strong>What is Virtual Reality?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">Virtual reality</a>&nbsp;(VR) is an artificial, computer-generated simulation or recreation of a real-life environment or situation. It immerses the user by making them feel like they are experiencing the simulated reality firsthand, primarily by stimulating their vision and hearing.</p>
<p>VR is typically achieved by wearing a headset like Facebook&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oculus.com/en-us/">Oculus</a>&nbsp;equipped with the technology, and is used prominently in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To create and enhance an imaginary reality for gaming, entertainment, and play (Such as video and computer games, or 3D movies, head mounted display).</li>
    <li>To enhance training for real life environments by creating a simulation of reality where people can practice beforehand (Such as flight simulators for pilots).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtual reality is possible through a coding language known as VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) which can be used to create a series of images and specify what types of interactions are possible for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>What is Augmented Reality?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.augment.com/">Augmented reality</a>&nbsp;(AR) is a technology that layers computer-generated enhancements atop an existing reality in order to make it more meaningful through the ability to interact with it. AR is developed into apps and used on mobile devices to blend digital components into the real world in such a way that they enhance one another but can also be told apart easily.</p>
<p>AR technology is quickly coming into the mainstream. It is used to display score overlays on telecasted sports games and pop out 3D emails, photos or text messages on mobile devices. Leaders of the tech industry are also using AR to do amazing and revolutionary things with holograms and motion activated commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Augmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality</strong></p>
<p>Augmented reality and virtual reality are inverse reflections of one in another with what each technology seeks to accomplish and deliver for the user. Virtual reality offers a digital recreation of a real-life setting, while augmented reality delivers virtual elements as an overlay to the real world.</p>
